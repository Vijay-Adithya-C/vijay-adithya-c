<h2>Context:</h2>
<p>On the 11th of May 2025, I completed the following article which tries to explain the Black-Scholes partial differential equation which helps price European options.</p>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>
  The Black-Scholes PDE is known for its stellar closed form solution to a partial differential equation which is meant to represent the movement of option prices in relation to the underlying asset (they derive the PDE and solve it in the paper). However, to understand the mechanism, one needs knowledge of stochastic calculus and solving PDE's that are stochastic in nature. I have hence tried my best to entertain the interested reader with the following article, having a decent amount of math, and necessary amount of intuition.
  I request all correspondence to be via the mail i have provided in the article, and I request the more experienced readers to give their much needed comments and suggestions via the same mail.
