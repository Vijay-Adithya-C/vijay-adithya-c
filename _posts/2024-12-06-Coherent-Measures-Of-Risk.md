<h2>Context:</h2>
<p>On the 6th of December 2024, I had presented the following PPT with the verbal explanation of what is detailed below. Scroll further to take a look at the PPT.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Value at Risk (VaR) is a commonly used financial risk measure that quantifies the potential loss in capital. 
  However, due to its limitations, a more robust measure called Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) was introduced, 
  offering desirable properties such as "coherence." We will review various risk measures and the axiomatics of coherence, 
  focusing on the strengths of CVaR. We will also discuss the implications of Mandelbrot’s theory of stable fat-tailed 
  distributions in asset pricing and the challenges they pose for risk estimation. Lastly, we will comment on recent 
  developments in quantile-based approaches in the pursuit of risk measures for stable distributions.
