Hi! I’m Vijay Adithya C, an undergrad at the [Madras School of Economics](https://www.mse.ac.in). I like working in the intersection of economics, higher mathematics, and philosophy — especially where nonobvious ideas meet the real world.

I was formerly Vice President of [Giffen](https://linktr.ee/giffenecofinmse), the Econ Fin Society at MSE, where we try to make economic thinking both serious and fun. My interests tend to drift toward niche topics in general, and also toward ideas related to economics which are unorthodox and interesting.

I enjoy listening to Indian classical music, reading Indian philosophy, and thinking about concepts which I haven't completely understood yet. 

Thanks for visiting!
